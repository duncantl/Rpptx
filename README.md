# Rpptx

This is a simple-minded package for reading tables from PPTX documents.

This uses the [Rcompression](https://github.com/omegahat/Rcompression) and [XML](https://github.com/omegahat/XML) packages.

It should probably use the [ROOXML](https://github.com/duncantl/ROOXML) package.


### Usage

```
pptxTables(filename)

pptxTables(filename, pages = c(3, 4, 9))
```
